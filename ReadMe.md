This folder contains TD projects for playing with Moire effects. 

Most of the interesting parameters are mapped to MIDI

Eg, in Moire-sphere - changing sphere columns+rows,  uniform scale, material and camera bg colours and composite type all have cool effects. In general for stronger moire effects, reduce the line width and increase the line density.
